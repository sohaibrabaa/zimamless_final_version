# Endpoint Status — mock → live promotion board

Mirror of `apps/web/lib/api/endpoint-status.ts`. Agent A flips **Announced live** when deployed; Agent B flips **B status** to `live` only after a same-day smoke test on the consuming screen. Demo-path endpoints must all be `live` before the Phase 9 rehearsal.

Legend: `mock` = MSW mock · `live` = real API, smoke-passed · `n/a` = not yet generated.

`GET /health` is deliberately **not** on this board. It is served outside the
`/v1` prefix, excluded from the frozen contract and from `/docs-json`, and so
never appears in the generated client — it is infrastructure, not a contract
endpoint, and has no mock→live promotion to track.

| Endpoint | Phase | Announced live (A, date) | B status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET /auth/me | 1 | — | mock | demo flag (D-10) included |
| POST /auth/context | 1 | — | mock | |
| PATCH /auth/language | 1 | — | mock | |
| POST /onboarding/register * | 2 | — | mock | v3.1.0 · consumed by supplier bootstrap form |
| GET /onboarding/applications-list * | 2 | — | mock | v3.1.0 · supplier onboarding home + reviewer queue |
| POST /onboarding/applications | 2 | — | mock | no screen consumes it — bootstrap (D-04) covers the supplier path |
| GET /onboarding/applications/{id} | 2 | — | mock | reviewer application detail |
| POST …/{id}/submit | 2 | — | mock | wizard step 4 |
| POST …/{id}/bank-account | 2 | — | mock | wizard step 4 |
| POST …/{id}/consents | 2 | — | mock | wizard step 3 · **consent catalogue provisional, see Q-09** |
| GET …/{id}/information-requests | 2 | — | mock | info-request inbox (both portals) |
| POST …/{id}/respond | 2 | — | mock | supplier response form |
| POST …/{id}/decide | 2 | — | mock | reviewer decision form · **reason-code catalogue provisional, see Q-06** |
| POST /government/lookup | 2 | — | mock | handler exists; no screen triggers a manual lookup yet |
| GET /government/requests/{id} | 2 | — | mock | handler exists; source panel reads the list on the application instead (Q-08) |
| GET /buyers/search | 3 | — | mock | wizard step 1 · returns `{candidates[], requiresManualReview}`; **never a selection** (ZM-BUY-009). `candidates[].matchSource` is `OWN_RELATIONSHIP`/`PLATFORM`/`REGISTRY` |
| POST /buyers/resolve | 3 | — | mock | wizard step 1 · **200**, not 201. `confirmedByUser:true` required. 409 `BUYER_BLOCKED` for SUSPENDED/STRUCK_OFF; UNDER_LIQUIDATION returns 200 with `requiresManualReview:true` (LT-02) |
| GET /buyers/{id} | 3 | — | mock | handler exists; screens read the buyer off the transaction. 404 (not 403) without a relationship; carries **no contact data** (ZM-BUY-008) |
| POST /documents/upload-url | 3 | — | mock | wizard steps 2–3 · **200**, not 201. PUT the file to `uploadUrl` yourself; no finalize call — hashing and OCR run lazily on first extraction read or at submit. Byte upload deliberately skipped under MSW |
| GET /documents/{id}/download-url | 3 | — | mock | no screen consumes it yet (needs the document list, **see Q-12**). Authorization checked **before** any URL is issued (ZM-DOC-004); refusal is 404; URL lives 2 minutes |
| GET /documents/{id}/extraction | 3 | — | mock | wizard step 2 (pre-fill + mismatch table) · first call triggers hashing + OCR (~2–5s). `qr.validationStatus`: `VALID`/`INVALID`/`UNPARSED`/`UNAVAILABLE` — **UNAVAILABLE means no QR on the page**, UNPARSED means one we could not read |
| GET/POST /transactions | 3 | — | mock | supplier transaction list; POST creates the wizard draft — 201, no body. `referenceNumber` is `ZM-<n>` |
| GET /transactions/{id} | 3 | — | mock | transaction detail · body varies by audience: supplier/platform get `minimumAcceptableAmount`, a bank never does (INV-8) |
| PUT …/{id}/invoice | 3 | — | mock | wizard step 2 · `outstandingAmount` recomputed server-side, never accepted. Money is 3-dp strings. Editable in DRAFT / INFORMATION_REQUIRED only (409 otherwise) |
| PUT …/{id}/buyer | 3 | — | mock | wizard step 1 · the buyer must have been resolved by this supplier first, else 422 |
| PUT …/{id}/minimum-amount | 3 | — | mock | wizard step 4 · 422 when above `outstandingAmount`; the error deliberately does **not** echo the floor back |
| POST …/{id}/declarations | 3 | — | mock | wizard step 5 · 201. All eight must be true; a false one is **422** with `details.notAffirmed[]` naming which · **template version provisional, see Q-13** |
| POST …/{id}/submit | 3 | — | mock | wizard step 6 · **200**, not 201. 409 `DUPLICATE_INVOICE` with `details.reviewReference` → blocked screen (ZM-VER-001, Q-11 resolved by that key) |
| GET …/{id}/verification | 3 | — | mock | verification panel · all 8 checks always recorded, passes included. `NOT_APPLICABLE` is not `PASS` |
| GET …/{id}/risk | 4 | — | mock | TrustScoreGauge/ComponentBars/FactorList on the supplier transaction detail and the bank underwriting view |
| GET/POST /admin/risk-models | 4 | — | mock | handler not implemented — no admin screen this session, not B's Phase 4 scope |
| POST …/{id}/listing | 5 | — | mock | supplier listing-activation screen, requires a real ELIGIBLE transaction |
| GET …/{id}/listing-current * | 5 | — | mock | v3.1.0 · listing-activation + offer comparison screens |
| GET /listings/{id} | 5 | — | mock | |
| GET /listings/{id}/offers | 5 | — | mock | role-split · offer comparison screen (supplier), own-offer check (bank) |
| GET /marketplace/eligible | 5 | — | mock | bank marketplace feed · real per-bank policy-filter eligibility (ZM-MKT-002) |
| GET /marketplace/listings/{id} * | 5 | — | mock | v3.1.0 · bank underwriting view, incl. the Phase 4 risk components |
| GET/POST /banks/policy-filters | 5 | — | mock | policy-filter configuration screen |
| PATCH /banks/policy-filters/{id} * | 5 | — | mock | v3.1.0 |
| POST /listings/{id}/offers/create | 5 | — | mock | offer form · server-computed commission/listing fee, generic floor rejection (ZM-MKT-012) |
| GET /offers * | 5 | — | mock | v3.1.0 · my offers + approval queue |
| GET/PATCH /offers/{id} | 5 | — | mock | offer status detail · revision creates a new version, prior retained immutably |
| POST /offers/{id}/approve | 5 | — | mock | approval queue · SELF_APPROVAL_FORBIDDEN enforced server-side |
| POST /offers/{id}/withdraw | 5 | — | mock | my offers · pre-acceptance, no penalty |
